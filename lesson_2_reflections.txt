What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git repository to store the meta-data of the repository. 
It implies the starting point of the git version control and initiates 
all the required files for storing the meta-data.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area differs itself from the working directory and repository 
from the fact that it is not the physical storage area. It is a logical 
grouping of related files that can fall under the same commit. It adds 
value by allowing incremental commits of logic.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

From the lot of unstaged files, we can add only those files which are 
logically related to each other and commit them under one commit 
message.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
history organized? How would branches help?

Situations like 
1. if I have to work and deliver on a different task without losing my 
current task.
2. work on multiple experimental changes.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It allows me to track changes/commits on the different branches of the 
working directory.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we 
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Combined the changes from both the branches. The diagram shows the 
merging point as wells as the different commits made on both the 
branches based on the timestamp.
