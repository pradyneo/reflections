What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git repository to store the meta-data of the repository. 
It implies the starting point of the git version control and initiates 
all the required files for storing the meta-data.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area differs itself from the working directory and repository 
from the fact that it is not the physical storage area. It is a logical 
grouping of related files that can fall under the same commit. It adds 
value by allowing incremental commits of logic.
