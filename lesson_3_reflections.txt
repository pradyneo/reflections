When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In most cases, I would like to have a remote repository. The reason for this is -
1. It serves as a backup of my work that I want to commit.
2. It would help me collaborate with other developers.
3. It's a clean way of managing my code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This gives me more control as to when I want to pull new changes. In 
most cases, I would like to pull the new code once I have a logical 
change to commit and wants to make sure that I have the latest code 
from the repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?

Forks are cloning someone else's repository to my github account. It is 
mainly a GitHub concept. I would be using it if I want my own 
development branch that experiment on without pushing changes to the 
original repo.
Clones mean cloning an existing repository. Theoritically, it can be 
from local to local, local to remote, remote to local or remote to 
remote. I would be mainly using it to clone a remote repo to my local 
developent system.
Branches means to create a development path from an existing commit. It 
can be merged with any other branch or the same from which it was 
created. I would be using it if I am working on fix, while also working 
on some other tasks unrelated with a fix or any similar kind of 
situation.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?
Mostly it serves as a checkpoint for tracking the changes even if the 
remote directory status has changed.
